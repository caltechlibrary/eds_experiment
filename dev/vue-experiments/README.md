vue.js experiments
==================

This folder holds various vue.js experiments done while learning how to use vue.js.  The examples from this directory came from the [Vue.js version 2 "getting started" guide](https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/).

The examples demonstrate how Vue attaches itself to a single DOM element (`#app` in this case) then fully controls it. The HTML provides some display elements, but everything else happens within the newly created Vue instance.

A Vue application consists of a root Vue instance created with new Vue, optionally organized into a tree of nested, reusable components.  Both elements and element attributes can be manipulated by Vue.  _When a Vue instance is created, it adds all the properties found in its data object to Vue’s reactivity system. When the values of those properties change, the view will “react”, updating to match the new values._ https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/instance.html

_Vue.js uses an HTML-based template syntax that allows you to declaratively bind the rendered DOM to the underlying Vue instance’s data. All Vue.js templates are valid HTML that can be parsed by spec-compliant browsers and HTML parsers._ https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/syntax.html
